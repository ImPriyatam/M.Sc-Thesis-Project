# **Master's Thesis Project: "Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Through Multi-wavelength Observations"**
Greetings! This file contains all the ipynb files related to my M.Sc thesis project.

**Overview:**
This GitHub repository showcases my master's thesis project, conducted as part of my master's degree in Astronomy at the Indian Institute of Technology Indore. The project focuses on the fascinating domain of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and involves the identification of Dyson Sphere candidates within the Milky Way using the GAIA database. The primary goal is to contribute to the exploration of potential Extraterrestrial Intelligence Civilizations.

**Key Features:**
- **Dyson Sphere Identification:** The project employs a novel approach to identify Dyson Sphere candidates, which are techno signatures of potential Extraterrestrial Intelligence Civilizations.
  
- **Red Fraction Parameter:** One of the core contributions is the development of the "Red Fraction" parameter. This parameter quantifies the dust obscuration surrounding Dyson Sphere candidates, aiding in the identification and differentiation of genuine candidates from false positives.

- **Advanced Algorithms and Data Analysis:** The project incorporates sophisticated algorithms to analyze photometric data retrieved from diverse sources including GAIA, 2MASS, WISE, and SDSS. The analysis leverages the G-K colour-magnitude diagram to quantify dust obscuration around Dyson Sphere candidates.

- **Cross-Verification:** The repository includes code for cross-verifying Dyson Sphere candidates using various astronomical databases such as Aladin Lite, VizieR, IRSA, and SDSS. This step is crucial in refining the list of candidates and ensuring accuracy.

- **Python Codebase:** The repository features a comprehensive Python codebase that facilitates the extraction of stellar data from the GAIA database using the Astroquery Python Library and Astronomical Database Query Language (ADQL). I have extensively used Python programming to work on this project.

**Benefits:**
- Contributes to the field of SETI by providing a systematic and data-driven approach to identify potential Dyson Sphere candidates.
  
- Offers insights into advanced data analysis techniques and the utilization of astronomical databases for research in the realm of Astrophysics.

- Showcases proficiency in Python programming, algorithms, and cross-referencing techniques.

**Project Outcome:**
I have found 166 stars in the Milky Way that could possibly have Extraterrestrial Intelligence Life. However, we need to verify this further and are planning to perform Optical and Infrared Spectroscopy on our top candidates.

This project has provided invaluable experience in ** large dataset handling, data analysis and visualisation, and the application of programming skills to tackle complex problems in Astrophysics**. The developed methodologies offer a unique contribution to the ongoing efforts in the search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
